Newman's lemma for the KO7 safe fragment.

Purpose:
- Packages the standard argument: termination (well-foundedness) + local joinability implies
  confluence (Church-Rosser) for the reflexive-transitive closure.

Scope boundary:
- This file is parameterized by a local-join hypothesis `locAll : ∀ a, LocalJoinAt a`.
- Termination for `SafeStep` is supplied by `wf_SafeStepRev_c` (from `Meta/ComputableMeasure.lean`).
- Nothing here claims confluence/termination for the full kernel `Step`.

Main exports:
- `newman_safe` / `confluentSafe_of_localJoinAt_and_SN`
- Corollaries about unique normal forms and stability of `normalizeSafe`, assuming `locAll`.
