# Impossibility Lemmas - mirror of failure catalog (fails_central + consolidation)

Goal
- Keep and enrich the centralized failure witnesses so they fully represent
  the failure taxonomy described in the project documentation.

What’s inside (all self‑contained, kernel unchanged)
- Small runnable branch and duplication witnesses aligned with the failure catalog.
- κ+ k counterexample on KO7 traces (R_rec_succ): ties by rfl branchwise.
- Flag‑only outer discriminator failure: concrete Step raises the flag.
- Duplication stress identity (toy calculus): additive counter non‑drop, plus
  DM and MPO orientation witnesses.
- Historical dead-end notes are recorded separately in
  `Docs/Impossibility_DeadEnds.md`.

Note
- Live theorems/examples compile and can be cited in the paper/docs.
- Historical dead-end commentary is kept out of this theorem file.

This theorem proves that no fixed additive constant `k` can orient the
`rec_succ` rule, especially for nested `delta` constructors. This refutes
the entire class of "additive bump" solutions.
-/
theorem kappa_plus_k_fails (k : Nat) :
  ¬ (∀ (b s n : Trace),
      kappa (app s (recΔ b s n)) + k < kappa (recΔ b s (delta n)) + k) := by
  -- We prove this by providing a concrete counterexample.
  push_neg
  -- The counterexample uses a nested `delta` to show the additive bump `+1` from
  -- the outer `delta` is cancelled by the `+1` from the inner `recΔ`.
  use void, void, delta void
  -- The goal is now a concrete inequality, which we can simplify.
  -- After simp, the goal is `¬(1 + k < 1 + k)`.
  simp [kappa]

/-! ### Theorem 2: Failure of Simple Lexicography
This theorem proves that a standard 2-component lexicographic measure `(κ, μ)`
fails because the primary component, `κ`, does not strictly decrease.
This forces the move to a more complex measure where the primary component is a
flag or a multiset designed to handle specific reduction rules.

        (kappa (recΔ b s (delta n)), mu (recΔ b s (delta n)))) := by

  -- The counterexample is `n := void`, which becomes the base case for `recΔ`
  -- after one step.
  use void, recΔ void void void, void
  -- After substituting, we need to show the Lex relation does not hold.
  -- This reduces to `¬ Lex (·<·) (·<·) (1, 0) (1, 0)`, which is decidable.

/-! ## Boolean δ-flag alone - explicit increase on a non-rec rule (fails_central §F)

Using only a “top-is-delta?” flag as the outer lex key breaks monotonicity:
there exists a Step that raises the flag. This mirrors the doc’s warning that
an unguarded global flag is unsafe; KO7 uses it only under a guard in safe
subrelations. -/

/-- Concrete increase: `merge void (delta void) → delta void` raises `deltaFlagTop`
from 0 to 1. This shows a flag-only primary component can increase on a legal
kernel step (violates lex monotonicity if used unguarded). -/

  · -- Compute flags: top of `merge void (delta void)` is not `delta`.

/-! ## Approach #9: Complex Hybrid/Constellation Measures (Paper §7, Item 9 in failure catalog)

Paper quote: "Attempts to combine measures in ad-hoc ways failed to provide
a uniform decrease across all 8 rules."

Constellation theory attempts to track the "shape" or "pattern" of subterms
rather than their numeric size. The idea is that certain constellations of
constructors signal termination progress. This fails because the δ-duplication
rule creates constellations that cannot be uniformly ordered.
-/
namespace ConstellationFailure

/-- A constellation is an abstraction of term structure (shape without content).
    Note: We use `recNode` instead of `rec` to avoid conflict with the eliminator. -/
inductive Constellation where
  | atom : Constellation
  | deltaNode : Constellation → Constellation
  | integrateNode : Constellation → Constellation
  | mergeNode : Constellation → Constellation → Constellation
  | appNode : Constellation → Constellation → Constellation
  | recNode : Constellation → Constellation → Constellation → Constellation
  | eqNode : Constellation → Constellation → Constellation
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr

/-- Extract constellation from a trace (forgetting content, keeping shape). -/
def toConstellation : Trace → Constellation
  | .void => .atom

  | .app a b => .appNode (toConstellation a) (toConstellation b)
  | .recΔ b s n => .recNode (toConstellation b) (toConstellation s) (toConstellation n)
  | .eqW a b => .eqNode (toConstellation a) (toConstellation b)

/-- The δ-duplication step produces structurally different constellations.
    The RHS has `appNode` at the root while LHS has `recNode`, so no simple ordering works. -/
theorem constellation_shapes_differ (b s n : Trace) :
    toConstellation (app s (recΔ b s n)) ≠ toConstellation (recΔ b s (delta n)) := by
  simp only [toConstellation]
  intro h
  cases h

/-- A simple constellation size measure (counting nodes). -/
def constellationSize : Constellation → Nat
  | .atom => 1
  | .deltaNode c => constellationSize c + 1
  | .integrateNode c => constellationSize c + 1
  | .mergeNode a b => constellationSize a + constellationSize b + 1
  | .appNode a b => constellationSize a + constellationSize b + 1
  | .recNode b s n => constellationSize b + constellationSize s + constellationSize n + 1
  | .eqNode a b => constellationSize a + constellationSize b + 1

/-- The δ-duplication rule does NOT decrease constellation size when s is non-trivial.
    This shows additive constellation measures fail just like numeric ones.
    LHS: recNode(b, s, deltaNode(n)) has size = |b| + |s| + (|n| + 1) + 1
    RHS: appNode(s, recNode(b, s, n)) has size = |s| + (|b| + |s| + |n| + 1) + 1
    Difference: RHS - LHS = |s| - 1 ≥ 0 when |s| ≥ 1. -/

end ConstellationFailure

/-! ## Approach #10: Unchecked Recursion (Paper §7, Item 10 in failure catalog)

Paper quote: "The raw duplicating rule is the canonical obstacle for global
aggregation: it entangles the relevant recursion counter with an irrelevant
duplicated mass trapped under inert app."

The rule `recΔ b s (delta n) → app s (recΔ b s n)`:
1. Duplicates `s` (appears once on LHS, twice on RHS)
2. The recursive `recΔ` call has `n` instead of `delta n`
3. BUT the `app s (...)` wrapping creates work that grows with each step

The recursion is "checked" only when restricted to `SafeStep`, which gates
certain steps behind a δ-phase condition.
-/
namespace UncheckedRecursionFailure

/-- Concrete witness: with a simple additive size, the RHS is NOT smaller. -/
def simpleSize : Trace → Nat
  | .void => 0
  | .delta t => simpleSize t + 1
  | .integrate t => simpleSize t + 1
  | .merge a b => simpleSize a + simpleSize b + 1
  | .app a b => simpleSize a + simpleSize b + 1
  | .recΔ b s n => simpleSize b + simpleSize s + simpleSize n + 1
  | .eqW a b => simpleSize a + simpleSize b + 1

/-- The rec_succ rule is the structural barrier for additive measures.
    LHS: simpleSize(recΔ b s (delta n)) = |b| + |s| + (|n| + 1) + 1 = |b| + |s| + |n| + 2
    RHS: simpleSize(app s (recΔ b s n)) = |s| + (|b| + |s| + |n| + 1) + 1 = 2|s| + |b| + |n| + 2
    Difference: RHS - LHS = |s| ≥ 0. No strict decrease when |s| ≥ 0.
    This is the "ultimate counterexample" from the paper. -/
theorem rec_succ_additive_barrier (b s n : Trace) :
    simpleSize (app s (recΔ b s n)) ≥ simpleSize (recΔ b s (delta n)) := by
  simp only [simpleSize]

/-- Stronger: RHS is strictly LARGER when s is non-void. -/

    simpleSize (app s (recΔ b s n)) > simpleSize (recΔ b s (delta n)) := by
  simp only [simpleSize]
  omega

/-- The full Step relation (not SafeStep) allows this barrier to be hit. -/

    ∃ b s n, Step (recΔ b s (delta n)) (app s (recΔ b s n)) := by
