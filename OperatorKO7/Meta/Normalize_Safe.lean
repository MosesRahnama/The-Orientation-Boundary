/-!
Certified normalization for the KO7 safe fragment.

Purpose:
- Defines `SafeStepStar` (multi-step closure of `SafeStep`).
- Defines `NormalFormSafe` and proves basic normal-form facts for the safe relation.
- Constructs a *computable certified* normalizer `normalizeSafe` for `SafeStep` using
  deterministic well-founded recursion.

Important scope boundary:
- Everything in this file is about `SafeStep` (the guarded fragment), not the full kernel `Step`.
- The normalizer is definitional/recursive (no `Classical.choose`); certificates are bundled directly.

Main exports:
- `normalizeSafe` and its certificates: `to_norm_safe`, `norm_nf_safe`
- Fixed-point characterizations: `nf_iff_normalize_fixed`, `not_fixed_iff_exists_step`
- Convenience bundles: `normalizeSafe_sound`, `normalizeSafe_total`
