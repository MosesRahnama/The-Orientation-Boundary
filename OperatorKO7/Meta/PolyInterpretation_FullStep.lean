# Nonlinear Polynomial Interpretation for the Full KO7 System

This module defines a nonlinear polynomial interpretation `W : Trace → Nat`
that strictly orients all 8 KO7 root rules.  This shows that the
full unguarded system is terminating by a direct global measure, provided
the measure lies outside every formalized barrier class.

The interpretation uses:
- `W(recΔ b s n) = (W(n) + 1) * (W(s) + W(b) + 1)` (nonlinear coupling)
- `W(delta t) = W(t) + 1` (non-transparent, since W(δt) ≠ W(t))

These two properties place `W` outside:
- Tier 1 (additivity violated by the multiplicative recursor)
- Tier 2 (δ-transparency violated: W(δ t) = W(t)+1 ≠ W(t))
- Affine class (linearity violated by the cross-term product)

The barrier theorems predict exactly this: any measure that orients the
duplicating step must import structural assumptions outside the formalized
classes.  This module provides a machine-checked witness confirming the
barrier's precision (Remark 4.5 of the paper).
