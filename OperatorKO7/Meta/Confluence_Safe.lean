Local confluence / local join analysis for the KO7 safe fragment.

Purpose:
- Defines local-join predicates for `SafeStep` (safe fragment) and for the full kernel `Step`.
- Proves local joinability lemmas for many safe root shapes, typically by uniqueness or vacuity.
- Records an explicit caveat for the full kernel: the two `eqW` rules overlap at `eqW a a`, so the
  full kernel `Step` is not locally confluent at `eqW void void` (and more generally has a peak at
  `eqW a a`).

Scope boundary:
- The positive results in this file are for `SafeStep` only.
- The negative result `not_localJoinStep_eqW_void_void` is about the full kernel `Step` and is used
  as a clarity point for the safe-vs-full distinction.

This file is typically paired with:
- `Meta/SafeStep_Ctx.lean` (context closure utilities)
- `Meta/Newman_Safe.lean` (Newman's lemma: SN + local join -> confluence), when a global local-join
  hypothesis is supplied.
