# Distinction Inexpressibility + Confluence-Axis Witness Order (WAVE2-E)

Self-contained reusable wrapper file. Two honest parts, nothing
re-proved: every headline result is discharged by citing an existing
unconditional theorem in the tree.

## Part 1 — named inexpressibility predicate

`DistinctionInexpressible` is a reusable named `Prop`, parameterised by
the evaluator/signature triple actually used by
`OperatorKO7.Meta.SafeStep.SyntacticNonDerivability.disequality_not_sigma_expressible_unconditional`
(the `SigmaFreeAlgebra.SigmaTerm` algebra and its substitution evaluator
`evalSigma`). It says: no single signature term `t` computes the
disequality `a ≠ b` as the predicate `evalSigma a b t ≠ void`. The KO7
instance `ko7_distinctionInexpressible` is the unconditional theorem,
re-wrapped under the named predicate.

## Part 2 — confluence-axis witness order (SCOPED & HONEST)

This is the confluence-axis analogue of the orientation-axis
`OperatorKO7.WitnessOrder` `WLevel`/`kappaGt` shape, scoped to exactly
what is provable here. The minimal claim is:

  raw object-level witness (unguarded `Step`) is INADEQUATE for diagonal
  local confluence, while the external-license witness (SafeStep guard)
  is ADEQUATE; hence the minimal adequate confluence-witness level is
  nonzero.

We do NOT build a fully-inhabited D0/D1/D2/D3 ladder. Only two levels are
named: `CWLevel.raw` (the object-level `Step` peak) and `CWLevel.license`
(the SafeStep external-distinction guard). Inadequacy of `raw` is
`OperatorKO7.Meta.EqW_Guard_Barrier.not_localJoinStep_eqW_refl`; adequacy
of `license` is
`OperatorKO7.Meta.SafeStep.GaugeFixingGuard.safestep_guard_restores_local_confluence`.
The order facts `kappaDist_pos` / `kappaDist_ge_one` package
"raw inadequate ∧ license adequate ⟹ witness order nonzero".

No `sorry`, `admit`, `axiom`, `native_decide`, `@[csimp]`, `unsafe`,
`partial`, or `opaque`. `GenericDiagonalFork` is NOT imported. No existing
file is modified.

/-! ## Part 1 — named inexpressibility predicate -/

/-- Reusable named predicate capturing "no direct signature term computes
disequality". Parameterised by an abstract carrier `S`, a designated
collapse point `nil : S`, and a three-argument evaluator
`ev : S → S → S → S` reading `ev a b t` as "term `t` evaluated with its
two predicate slots bound to `a` and `b`".

`IsDistinctionInexpressible ev nil` holds when there is NO single signature
term `t` whose induced predicate `ev a b t ≠ nil` coincides, for every
pair `(a, b)`, with the disequality `a ≠ b`. This is the abstract shape of
the W16.7 commercial claim; the KO7 instance below pins `S`, `nil`, `ev`
to the real `SigmaFreeAlgebra` types. -/
def IsDistinctionInexpressible {S : Type} (ev : S → S → S → S) (nil : S) : Prop :=
  ¬ ∃ t : S, ∀ a b : S, (a ≠ b) ↔ (ev a b t ≠ nil)

/-- The KO7 instance of `IsDistinctionInexpressible`, specialised to the
`SigmaFreeAlgebra.SigmaTerm` signature algebra, its substitution evaluator
`evalSigma`, and the `void` collapse point. Proven by citing the
unconditional theorem
`disequality_not_sigma_expressible_unconditional`; nothing is re-proved. -/

    IsDistinctionInexpressible (S := SigmaTerm) evalSigma SigmaTerm.void :=

unconditional non-expressibility statement over `SigmaTerm`. -/

/-! ## Part 2 — confluence-axis witness order (SCOPED & HONEST) -/

/-- Coarse confluence-axis witness levels. SCOPED: only the two genuinely
inhabited-and-distinguished levels are named. `raw` is the object-level
unguarded `Step` peak; `license` is the external SafeStep distinction
guard that supplies the disequality decision from outside the rewriting
layer. This mirrors the orientation-axis `OperatorKO7.WitnessOrder.WLevel`
shape (an `inductive` with a `toNat` grade and `LE`/`LT` instances) but is
deliberately a small local definition rather than a full D0..D3 ladder,
because only these two levels are provably adequate/inadequate here. -/

/-- Adequacy of a confluence-witness level for the diagonal `eqW`
critical pair, scoped to exactly what each level can do.

  * `raw`: adequate iff the unguarded object-level `Step` peak at
    `eqW a a` is locally joinable for every `a`. (It is NOT — that is
    `not_localJoinStep_eqW_refl`.)
  * `license`: adequate iff, given an external distinction guard
    `SafeStepGuard a b`, the SafeStep peak at `eqW a b` is locally
    joinable. (It IS — that is `safestep_guard_restores_local_confluence`.)

This is a layer-honest definition: it asks each level for precisely the
join it is responsible for, no more. -/

/-- `κ_dist ≥ 1`: restated on the numeric grade. The grade of a

above the raw grade (`0`). The unguarded diagonal query must climb above
the raw object level. -/

/-- **`κ_dist = 1` (the minimal adequate level is exactly one, not merely nonzero).**
On the two-level grade, every diagonally adequate level has numeric grade at least one,
since the only grade-zero level is `raw` and it is inadequate; and the grade-one level
`license` is adequate. The minimal adequate confluence-witness grade is therefore
exactly one: the external disequality license is the minimal level that repairs the
diagonal, and no object-level (grade-zero) witness suffices. -/
