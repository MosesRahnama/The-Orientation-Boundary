# The faithfulness no-go for dynamical boundary functors

`DynamicalBoundaryFunctor` exhibits collapse-preserving dynamical functors from the
full kernel `Step` and the guarded `SafeStep` into the distinction and orientation
boundaries, and proves one such functor non-faithful. This module turns that single
non-faithfulness fact into a general impossibility theorem and closes the last open
question of the duality program.

The bridge is the boundary-operator `payloadDiscarding` law. A dynamical functor is
*payload-faithful* when the boundary verdict recovers the discarded payload over the
functor's object image. The no-go theorem shows that a functor whose object map
covers the boundary domain can never be payload-faithful, because a recovery over the
image extends to a recovery over the whole domain, which is exactly what
`payloadDiscarding` forbids. Since `payloadDiscarding` is a defining field of every
`BoundaryOperator`, no payload-discarding boundary admits a faithful dynamical functor
with covering object map. The distinction and orientation collapse functors are
concrete instances.

It contains no `sorry`, no new `axiom`, no `native_decide`, and no `@[csimp]`; the
public theorems are spot-checked with `#print axioms` (baseline whitelist
`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`).
