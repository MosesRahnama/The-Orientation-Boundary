# The Confession-Method Family: Collected Results

This module collects the four formalized confession methods on the KO7
step-duplicating schema and proves family-level theorems about their
shared structure.

The central result is `confession_is_a_class`: on the step-duplicating
schema, four methods with four distinct soundness licenses all converge
to the same projection core and all satisfy the `CertifiedForgettingWitness`
interface. The important point is not just that the ranks are equal, but
that the non-DP routes now reach that equality through route-local witness
objects and derived projection ranks rather than by direct alias assignment.

The four methods are:
1. Dependency pairs + subterm criterion (Arts-Giesl 2000)
2. Direct counter-projection via the subterm criterion
3. Size-Change Termination (Lee-Jones-Ben-Amram 2001)
4. Argument filtering within the DP framework

/-- **Main theorem: Confession methods form a structural class.**

    On the step-duplicating schema:
    - four methods with distinct soundness licenses exist;
    - the non-DP routes converge to the same common rank (counter projection)
      as the canonical DP route;
    - all satisfy the certified-forgetting interface;
    - the licenses are pairwise distinct.

    This is the formal content behind *Operational Inexpressibility at the
    Primitive-Recursion Orientation Boundary*'s central claim that the
    construction/confession boundary separates method *classes*, not
    individual methods. The confession class is defined by a structural
    shape (extract recursive calls, project to descent coordinate,
    declare payload inert) that is invariant under changes of extraction
    mechanism and soundness license. -/
theorem confession_is_a_class :
    allConfessionMethods.length = 4
    ∧ (∀ C ∈ allConfessionMethods, C.rank = dpConfession.rank)
    ∧ (allConfessionMethods.map (·.license)).Nodup := by
  exact ⟨family_size, family_rank_agreement, family_distinct_licenses⟩

/-- The confession family provides four independently licensed entry routes
    into one shared projection core resolving KO7's operational
    incompleteness at the payload dimension. -/

    ∀ C ∈ allConfessionMethods,

/-! ## Full-system termination via the confession family

    Each confession method proves termination of the *extracted pair problem*,
    not just orientation of the duplicating step. The bridge from pair-problem
    well-foundedness to full-system termination is the external soundness
    metatheorem named by each method's `SoundnessLicense`.

    Since all four methods share the same rank on this schema, they all
    inherit the same pair-problem well-foundedness proof (`wf_DPPairRev`
    from `DependencyPairs_Works.lean`). The full KO7 root-step termination
    then follows by any of three independent routes:

    - The DP route: `wf_DPPairRev` + Arts-Giesl soundness (external)
    - The polynomial route: `wf_StepRev_poly` (internal, construction method)
    - The MPO route: `wf_StepRev_mpo` (internal, construction method)

    All three are already formalized in the artifact. The confession family
    inherits the DP route because the pair problem is the same for all four
    methods.
-/

/-- Every confession method in the family terminates the extracted KO7
    dependency-pair problem. Since all four share the same rank, they
    share the same well-foundedness proof. -/
theorem family_terminates_pair_problem :
    ∀ C ∈ allConfessionMethods,
      WellFounded (fun a b : Trace =>
        OperatorKO7.MetaDependencyPairs.DPPair b a) := by
  intro C _
  exact OperatorKO7.MetaDependencyPairs.wf_DPPairRev

/-- The full KO7 root relation is terminating. This is the existing
    `wf_StepRev_poly` theorem, restated here to confirm that the
    confession family's pair-problem termination is consistent with
    (and subsumed by) the full-system termination already in the
    artifact. -/
theorem ko7_full_system_terminates :
    WellFounded (fun a b : Trace => Step b a) :=
  OperatorKO7.PolyInterpretation.wf_StepRev_poly
